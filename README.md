# day-planner
a website used to plan out the rest of your day

Day is displayed at the top of calendar.
You can add different tasks to hourly time blocks.
Time blocks are color coded to indicate wether it is in the past, present, or future.
When you save your text it is saved into local storage and when you reload the page those changes persist.
